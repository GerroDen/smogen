<h1>Usage Instructions</h1>

This plugin adds a Generate Matcher menu option to the Code menu in IntelliJ IDEA.<br/>

The generated class has a dependency on the supporting SMOG library, hosted at https://github.com/mistraltechnologies/smog
and available from <a href="http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails|com.mistraltech.smog|smog-core|1.0|jar)">Maven Central</a>.<br/>
